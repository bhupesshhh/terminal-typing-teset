One day the people that don't even believe in you will tell everyone how they met you.
If I'm gonna tell a real story, I'm gonna start with my name.
If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.
Have enough courage to start and enough heart to finish.
Hate comes from intimidation, love comes from appreciation.
I could agree with you but then we'd both be wrong.
Oh, the things you can find, if you don't stay behind.
Determine your priorities and focus on them.
Never let your emotions overpower your intelligence.
Nothing lasts forever but at least we got these memories.
Don't you know your imperfections is a blessing?
